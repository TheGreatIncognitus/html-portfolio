<h1>TD's 2024 Movie Ranking</h1>
<h2>The year in movies (so far!)</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Dune - Part Two</h3>
<p>A sci-fi masterpiece on every level, and a gripping payoff of the foundation paved by Part One.</p>
<h3>Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</h3>
<p>A thoroughly enjoyable blockbuster that fully embraces its own absurdity. I yearn for a return to the franchise's original, darker tone, but I'll still be here for a good time such as this.</p>
<h3>Argylle</h3>
<p>Good fun even as the convoluted story veers into nonsense. Vaughn's style works better with a harder rating.</p>
<h3>Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire</h3>
<p>A decent effort to expand the lore of the franchise, but the overstuffed cast and meandering plot culminate in an underwhelming payoff.</p>
